#Hello Git and GitHub

## This is my first public repository!

**This project refers to Mixed Messages Challenge at Codecademy's course**
==========================================================================

**First: Plan a project!**

*The goals of my project*

- Message generator program that if user runs a program, he should get a new,randomized output.

-The message that it outputs should be made up of at least three diffrent pieces of data.

- Build program with Java Script

- Use Git version control

- Use command line

- Develop locally on my computer


*Second: Make a super To Do List* :sunglasses:

| To Do | Func | Done |
|-------|------|-------|
|Set up version control| Set up Git tracking in my directory and add and commit changes | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Plan my project | Visualize my end result. What is it built with? What can it do? |.|
| Come Up with a Topic | Decide on what types of messages I want my program to output |.|
| Create the message | Add functionality to randomly select the diffrent message components so they create a cohesive message |.|
| Create script and run it locally | Create JS file to write my code - abe to run locally in Node |.|
| Store message components | Decide how to store all of the message compontens |.|
| Put the program together | Combine the diffrent part of my program so the random messages are selected,combined,and then displayed to the user each time they run the program |||
| Expand my project | Do the extra cool features |.|
